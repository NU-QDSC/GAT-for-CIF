# GAT-for-CIF
This repository contains example code and functions to implement the Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) to de-identify clinical trial data and integrate the results into the Cancer InFocus (CIF) R shiny application. De-identification is achieved by merging census tracts using GAT to meet a minimum required value. Data contained within are randomly generated and do not contain any patient information. 

Reviewing the [GAT walkthrough](https://nystracking.github.io/gatpkg/dev/articles/gat_tutorial.html) is strongly encouraged before starting this process.

# Instructions
1. Download the repository and change input and output paths accordingly. 
2. Run the Functions script to create the shapefiles and Map_Save functions. 
3. Run the SHAPER script to walk through an example of using GAT to de-identify data. 
4. Review results saved to the Output and www folders
5. Change the SHAPER script paths and inputs to de-identify other data.

For any questions regarding the code or process, please email Daniel Antonio at daniel.antonio@northwestern.edu.
